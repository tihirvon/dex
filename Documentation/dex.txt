@h1 NAME

%PROGRAM%

@h1 SYNOPSIS

%PROGRAM% [-c command] [-t tag] [-r rcfile] [-V] [file]...

@h1 DESCRIPTION

A small and flexible text editor.

@h1 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

-c command
	Run this command after reading the rc file and opening any files
	specified on command line.

-r rcfile
	Read this rc file instead of ~/.%PROGRAM%/rc or /usr/share/%PROGRAM%/rc.

-t tag
	Go to tag.  Requires tags file generated by Exuberant Ctags.

-R
	Don't read the rc file.

-V
	Display the version number and exit.

@h1 BASIC USAGE

Here's some of the default key bindings. *M-x* means meta-x or alt-x and
*^V* is ctrl-v. See /usr/share/%PROGRAM%/bindings/default for more keys.

	@li M-s
	select
	@li ^V
	select lines
	@li ^Y
	copy current line or selection
	@li ^D
	cut current line or selection
	@li ^P
	paste
	@li ^E
	undo
	@li ^R
	redo
	@li ^C
	enter command line
	@li M-/
	search
	@li M-n
	search next
	@li M-p
	search previous
	@li M-`N`
	activate `N`th tab

On the command line you can use tab to complete commands and most of
their parameters. Run *next* or *prev* to switch to next or previous
file. The commands *open*, *save* and *quit* should be obvious.

@h1 COMMANDS

alias <name> <command>
	Create an alias to command.

	Example:
		alias read "pass-through cat"

	Now you can run "read file.txt" to insert file.txt to current
	file.

bind <key> [command]
	Bind a key to command. If command is not given then binding for
	the key is removed.

	A key is one of:
		Control key, for example "^C"

		Meta-key, for example "M-x" (alt-x) where x is any ASCII
		character (use "space" or "sp" for space).

		Key chain, for example "^X c" (press ^X and then c).
		Keys are separated by spaces.

		Special key

	Special keys:
		insert delete home end pgup pgdown left right up down f1
		f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 f9 f10 f11 f12 sleft sright

		sleft is shifted left arrow and sright is shifted right
		arrow.

bof
	Move to beginning of file.

bol
	Move to beginning of line.

case [-lmu]
	Change text case. Default is to change lower case to upper and
	vice versa.

	-l lower case

	command line (see the default binding *^L* why this is useful).

compile [-1ps] <errorfmt> <command> [parameters]...
	Run external command and collect error messages. This can be
	used to run `make` and `grep`.

	-1 read error messages from stdout instead of stderr

	-p display "Press any key to continue" prompt

	-s silent. both stderr and stdout are redirected to /dev/null

	See also *errorfmt* and *msg* commands.

copy
	Copy current line or selection.

cut
	Cut current line or selection.

delete
	Delete character or selection.

delete-eol
	Delete to end of line.

delete-word [-s]
	Delete word after cursor.

	-s be more "aggressive"

filter <command> [parameter]...
	Filter selected text or whole file through external command.

	Example: filter sort -r

format-paragraph [width]
	Format the paragraph cursor is located on or selection. If
	paragraph width is not given then the *text-width* option is
	used.

	This command merges selection into one paragraph. To format
	multiple paragraphs use the external command `fmt` with *filter*
	command. E.g. *filter fmt -w 60*.

ft <filetype> <extension>...
	Add extensions for filetype.

ft -c <filetype> <regexp>...
	Detect filetype by matching the regexp against first line of
	file.

ft -f <filetype> <regexp>...

	Attributes: bold lowintensity underline blink reverse invisible
	keep

	The color and attribute value "keep" is useful in selected text
	to keep fg-color and attributes and change only bg-color.

@h1 OPTIONS

Options can be changed using the *set* command. Enumerated option values
can also be *toggle*d. To see which options are enumerated type "toggle "
on command line and press tab.

@h2 Local and global options

Global values of these options serve as default values for local
(per-file) options.

auto-indent [true]
	Automatically insert indentation when pressing enter.
	Indentation is copied from previous non-empty line. If also the
	*indent-regex* local option is set then indentation is
	automatically increased if the regular expression matches
	current line.

emulate-tab [false]
	Make *delete*, *erase* and moving *left* and *right* inside
	indentation feel as if there were tabs instead of spaces.

expand-tab [false]
	Convert tab to spaces on insert.

file-history [true]
	Save line and column for each file to ~/.%PROGRAM%/file-history.

indent-width [8]
	Size of indentation in spaces.

syntax [true]
	Use syntax highlighting.

tab-width [8]
	Width of tab. Recommended value is 8. If you use other
	indentation size than 8 you should use spaces to indent.

text-width [72]
	Preferred with of text. Used as default value for
	*format-paragraph*.

ws-error [special]
	Comma separated list of flags that describe what whitespace
	errors should be highlighted. Set to `0` to disable.

	trailing
		Display trailing whitespace as error.

	space-indent
		Display spaces in indentation as error. Note that this
		still allows using less than `tab-width` spaces at end
		of indentation for alignment.

	space-align
		Display spaces used as alignment after tabs in
		indentation as error.

	tab-indent
		Display tabs in indentation as errors. If you set this
		you most likely want to set `tab-after-indent` too.

	tab-after-indent
		Display tabs used anywhere else but indentation as
		errors.

	special
		Display all characters that look like regular space as
		errors. One of these characters is no-break space
		(U+00A0) which is often accidentally typed (AltGr+space
		in some keyboard layouts).

@h2 Local only options

brace-indent [false]
	Scan for { and } when calculating indentation size. Depends on
	the *auto-indent* option.

filetype [none]
	Type of file. Value must be previously registered using the *ft*
	command.

indent-regex [""]
	If this regular expression matches current line when enter is
	pressed and *auto-indent* is true then indentation is increased.
	Set to "" to disable.

@h2 Global only options

newline [unix]
	Whether to use LF (`unix`) or CRLF (`dos`) line-endings. This is
	just a default value for new files.

statusline-left [" %f%s%m%r%s%M"]
	Format string for the left aligned part of status line.

	@li %f
	Filename.

	@li %m
	"\*" if file is has been modified since last save.

	@li %r
	"RO" if file is read-only.

	@li %y
	Cursor row.

	@li %x
	Cursor display column.

	@li %X
	Cursor column as characters. If it differs from cursor
	display column it is show too (e.g. "2-9").

	@li %p
	Position in percentage.

	@li %E
	File encoding.

	@li %M
	Miscellaneous status information.

	@li %n
	Line-ending (LF or CRLF).

	@li %s
	Add separator.

	@li %t
	File type.

	@li %u
	Hexadecimal unicode value value of character under cursor.

	@li %%
	Literal %.

statusline-right [" %y,%X   %u   %E %n %t   %p "]
	Format string for the right aligned part of status line.

display-special [false]
	Display special characters.

esc-timeout [100] 0...2000
	When single escape is read from the terminal %PROGRAM% waits some
	time before treating the escape as a single keypress. The
	timeout value is in milliseconds.

	Too long timeout makes escape key feel slow and too small
	timeout can cause escape sequences of for example arrow keys to
	be split and treated as multiple key presses.

show-line-numbers [false]
	Show line numbers.

show-tab-bar [true]
	Show tab bar at top of screen.

lock-files [true]
	Lock files using ~/.%PROGRAM%/file-locks. Only protects from your
	own mistakes (two processes editing same file).

scroll-margin [0]
	Minimum number of lines to keep visible before and after cursor.

case-sensitive-search [true]
	false
		Search is case-insensitive.
	true
		Search is case-sensitive.
	auto
		If search string contains a uppercase letter search is
		case-sensitive, otherwise it is case-insensitive.

@h1 COMMAND SYNTAX

Command syntax is similar to shell but simpler.

Commands are separated either by newline or ";" character. To make a
command span multiple lines in a rc file escape the newline (put \\ at end
of line).

Rc files can contain comments at beginning of line. Comment begins with
# character and can be indented, but you can't put comment on same line
with a command. This decision was made to make it possible to include #
in commands without escaping.

Commands can contain environment variables. Variable always expands into
a single argument even if it contains whitespace. Variables inside
single or double quotes are NOT expanded. This makes it possible to bind
a key to command which contains variable (inside single or double
quotes) and the variable is expanded just before the command is
executed.

Example:
	alias x "run chmod 755 $FILE"

$FILE is expanded when the alias x is executed. The command works even
if $FILE contains whitespace.

@h2 Special variables

These are always defined and override environment variables of same
name.

$PKGDATADIR
	Usually /usr/share/dex
$FILE
	Current file. Empty string if there's no filename.
$WORD
	Selected text or word under cursor. Empty string if there's no
	selection and cursor is not on a word.

@h2 Single quoted strings

Can't contain single quote, no escaping possible.

@h2 Double quoted strings
@li \\a
Bell
@li \\b
Backspace
@li \\t
Horizontal tab
@li \\n
New line
@li \\v
Vertical tab
@li \\f
Form feed
@li \\r
Carriage return
@li \\\\
Literal \\
@li \\x0a
Hexadecimal byte value 0x0a. Note that 0x00 is not supported because
strings are NUL-terminated.

@h1 COMMAND LINE

In command line you can use up and down arrows to browse command history
and tab to complete commands and most of their arguments.

Here's list of key bindings (totally obvious keys left out):

@li ^A
Go to beginning of command line.
@li ^B
Move left.
@li ^C
Leave command line.
@li ^D
Delete.
@li ^E
Go to end of command line.
@li ^F
Move right.
@li ^K
Delete to end of command line.
@li ^U
Delete to beginning of command line.
@li ^V
Insert special character.
@li ^W
Erase word.
@li ^Z
Suspend.

@h1 SEARCH MODE

Search pattern is an extended regular expression.

Same keys work as in command mode, plus these additional keys:

@li M-c
Toggle *case-sensitive-search* option.
@li M-r
Reverse search direction.

@h1 FILES

~/.%PROGRAM%/rc
	You personal configuration.

~/.%PROGRAM%/syntax/\*
	Your personal syntax files.  These override the syntax files which
	come with the program.

	opened in another process. Used only if *lock-files* is true.

~/.%PROGRAM%/command-history and ~/.%PROGRAM%/search-history
	Command and search history.

~/.%PROGRAM%/file-history
